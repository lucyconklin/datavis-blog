        <p>In April 2017 I emerged, alive and exhausted, from the Backend
          program at the
          <a href="https://www.turing.io/" target="blank">
            Turing School for Software &amp; Design
          </a> with a shiny new certificate and a bunch of cool new skills. Over
          the course of my ensuing job search, I have kept track of every
          application and how it progressed. I'm a bit of a spreadsheet addict,
          so this was all stored in a GoogleSheet (
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eOfeJPBcO2GBdiHPwehh3tTTpZNq-fftrihsNHkksng/edit?usp=sharing">
            sanitized, blank template
          </a>
          ). This way I could quickly check in on how my job search was
          progressing and how close I was to my goal of 100 rejections
          <a href="#rejections">
            *
          </a>. But gleaning insights from a spreadsheet is not always easy, so
          I knew a visual would help me share my findings.</p>
        <h3>Datavisualization</h3>
        <p>Data visualization has always been a passion of mine. Before I went
          back to school (again) I worked in the science communication field.
          When I come across some data, I like to think about the best way to
          visualize it. I also thought sharing the actual numbers from my job
          search might help others on theirs. And another goal of this exercise
          was to get more experience with the
          <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="blank">
            d3 library
          </a>
          for data visualization.
        </p>
        <p>My first thought was some kind of bar graph, but that seemed
          uninspiring. Plus, I've been pushing myself to take advantage of my
          new coding skills and go beyond a static 2D image with something
          interactive. I generally stay far far away from pie graphs, but after
          some sketching and brainstorming a pie actually seemed like the right
          direction to go. So I went to the d3 site for some inspiration and
          found
          <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/766f8f6d31f645c39f488a0befa1e3c8">
            this sunburst example
          </a>
          being used for sequences of events, and
          thought I would adapt it for the various lifecyles of my applications.
        </p>

        <div id="chart">
          <div id="explanation" style="visibility: hidden;">
            <span id="percentage"></span><br/>
            <span id="sequence-description"></span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="sequence"></div>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The total time of my search was 101 days. Of the 38 applications I
          submitted, about a third received no response whatsoever, 21% were
          rejected right away, and another 16% received an automated reply that
          the application had been received, but nothing further.
        </p>
        <p>That left 12 applications leading to interviews (9 over the phone,
          3 in person). From there, I had 4 tech challenges, one pairing, and
          one group interview via Google Hangout. I should mention that this
          was an 8 person interview, which seemed insane to me. But, I was
          pleasantly surprised as it was both enjoyable, and well orchestrated.
        </p>
        <p>In the end I got a total of 3 offers, and went with the one that was
          the best culture and skill match. Now I'm working at an Atlanta-based
          startup called <a href="" target="blank">SingleOps</a> on their Rails
          project management application.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Yeah, this is a numbers game, but prioritize quality over
            quantity.</strong> Most of the Indeed/Monster/big job aggregate
            postings I applied to never even received a response, which is both
            rude and disheartening. They are not a good ROI for your time, try
            to talk to actual people.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Make connections at a steady rate,</strong> even if you
            are getting interviews. There is definitely an ebb and flow with job
            searching, so it helps to put good solid effort into 1-2 connections
            every day rather than getting sloppy while applying to 7 jobs at once.
          </li>
          <li><h4>Check your calendar every morning before 9:00.</h4>
            You'll probably have lots of calls, interviews, and meetings and
            will need to keep them all straight. Don't make my mistake; I was
            late to a remote pairing for a job I really liked, and you basically
            can't recover from that. And if you make a big mistake, it's ok, it
            happens. You'll still get a job.
          </li>
          <li><h4>"Could you describe the lifecycle of your code?"</h4> This
            was my favorite question to ask in interviews. It was a great way
            to find out how code is implemented and the kinds of tools you might
            be using on the job. Plus, the developers I asked were generally
            excited to share that kind of detail, and it often led to other
            questions. Pretty much every time, the tools they mentioned were
            very often ones I'd encountered at Turing.
          </li>
          <li><h4>Exercise/have hobbies/socialize.</h4> This is certainly a
            'do as I say, not as I do' situation. Don't forget about all of
            your other basic needs, and don't neglect self-care. It will make
            the whole process much easier, and your loved ones will thank you.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Thank You</h3>
        <p>This would not have been possible without the staff and students at
          the Turing School, as well as my wonderful, supportive, and very
          patient family. I would like to specifically thank Meg Stewart at
          Turing for some much appreciated and timely advice, Ian Douglas for
          his incredibly helpful coaching, resume review, and tech interview
          tips, and my rejection buddy Jesse for keeping me accountable.
        </p>
        <h3 id="rejections">About those Rejections</h3>
        <p>I came across a concept a few years ago that was instrumental in
          helping me reframe how I think about failure. It was based on
          <a href="http://lithub.com/why-you-should-aim-for-100-rejections-a-year/">
            a blog post about 100 rejections
          </a>
          . Basically, the writer asked his friend how she was able to get all
          of these prestigious awards/honors/residencies and she told him about
          her yearly goal of getting rejected 100 times. Although I fell far
          short of 100 rejections, having a rejection quota really took the
          sting out of every single one of those rejection emails.
