        <h1>My Post-Bootcamp Job Search by the Numbers</h1>
        <h2>Getting ghosted and getting the job</h2>

      <div class="blog-main">
        <p>In April 2017 I emerged, alive and exhausted, from the Backend program at the
          Turing School for Software &amp; Design with a shiny new certificate
          and a bunch of cool new skills. Over the course of my ensuing job
          search, I have kept track of every application and how it progressed.
          I'm a bit of a spreadsheet addict, so this was all stored in a Google
          Sheet (
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eOfeJPBcO2GBdiHPwehh3tTTpZNq-fftrihsNHkksng/edit?usp=sharing">
            sanitized, blank template
          </a>
          ). This way I could quickly check in on how my job search was
          progressing and how close I was to my goal of 100 rejections
          <a href="#rejections">
            *
          </a>. But gleaning insights from a spreadsheet is not always easy, so
          I knew a visual would help me share my findings.</p>
        <h3>Datavisualization</h3>
        <p>My first thought was some kind of bar graph, but that seemed
          uninspiring. Plus, I've been pushing myself to take advantage of my
          new coding skills and go beyond a static 2D image with something
          interactive. I generally stay far far away from pie graphs, but after
          some sketching and brainstorming a pie actually seemed like the right
          direction to go. So I went to the <a href="">d3 site</a> for some inspiration and
          found <a href="">this sunburst example</a> being used for sequences of events, and
          thought I would adapt it for the various lifecyles of my applications.

        <div id="chart">
          <div id="explanation" style="visibility: hidden;">
            <span id="percentage"></span><br/>
            <span id="sequence-description"></span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="sequence"></div>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The total time of my search was 101 days. Of the 38 applications I
          submitted, about a third received no response whatsoever, 18% were
          rejected right away, and another 18% received an automated reply that
          the application had been received, but nothing further.
        </p>
        <p>That left 12 applications leading to interviews (9 over the phone,
          3 in person). From there, I had 4 tech challenges, one pairing, and
          one group interview via Google Hangout. I should mention that this
          was an 8 person interview, which seemed insane to me. But, I was
          pleasantly surprised as it was both enjoyable, and well orchestrated.
        </p>
        <p>In the end I got a total of 3 offers, and went with the one that was
          the best culture and skill match.
        </p>
        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Yeah, this is a numbers game, but prioritize quality over
            quantity.</strong> Most of the Indeed/Monster/big job aggregate
            postings I applied to never even received a response, which is both
            rude and disheartening. They are not a good ROI for your time, try
            to talk to actual people.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Make connections at a steady rate,</strong> even if you
            are getting interviews. There is definitely an ebb and flow with job
            searching, so it helps to put good solid effort into 1-2 connections
            every day rather than getting sloppy while applying to 7 jobs at once.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="rejections">About those Rejections</h3>
        <p>I came across a concept a few years ago that was instrumental in
          helping me reframe how I think about failure. It was based on
          <a href="http://lithub.com/why-you-should-aim-for-100-rejections-a-year/">
            a blog post about 100 rejections
          </a>
          . Basically, the writer asked his friend how she was able to get all
          of these prestigious awards/honors/residencies and she told him about
          her yearly goal of getting rejected 100 times. Although I fell far
          short of 100 rejections, having a rejection quota really took the
          sting out of every single one of those rejection emails.
