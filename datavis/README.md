# My Post-Bootcamp Job Search by the Numbers
## clever tagline. Getting ghosted and getting ahead.
Lucy Conklin July 25, 2017

In April 2017 I emerged, alive, from the Backend program at the Turing School for Software & Design with a shiny new certificate and a bunch of cool new skills. Over the course of my ensuing job search, I have kept track of every application and how it progressed. I'm a bit of a spreadsheet addict, so this was all stored in a Google Sheet ([sanitized, blank template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eOfeJPBcO2GBdiHPwehh3tTTpZNq-fftrihsNHkksng/edit?usp=sharing)). This way I could quickly check in on how my job search was progressing and how close I was to my goal of 100 rejections*. But gleaning insights from a spreadsheet is not always easy, so I knew a visual would help me share my findings.

### Datavisualization

Data visualization has always been a passion of mine. I have been working in the science communication field for about 4 years now, so when I come across some data, I like to think about the best way to visualize it. I also thought sharing the actual numbers from my job search might help others on theirs. And another goal of this exercise was to get more experience with the [d3 library](https://d3js.org/) for data visualization.

My first thought was some kind of bar graph, but that seemed uninspiring. Plus, I've been pushing myself to take advantage of my new coding skills and go beyond a static 2D image with something interactive. I generally stay far far away from pie graphs, but after some sketching and brainstorming a pie actually seemed like the right direction to go. So I went to the d3 website for some inspiration and found this [sunburst example](https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/766f8f6d31f645c39f488a0befa1e3c8) being used for sequences of events, and thought I would adapt it for the various lifecyles of my applications.

### Results

The total time of my search was 101 days. Of the 38 applications I submitted, about a third received no response whatsoever, 18% were rejected right away, and another 18% received an automated reply that the application had been received, but nothing further.

That left 12 applications leading to interviews (9 over the phone, 3 in person). From there, I had 4 tech challenges, one pairing, and one group interview via Google Hangout. I should mention that this was an 8 person interview, which seemed insane to me. But, I was pleasantly surprised as it was both enjoyable, and well orchestrated.

In the end I got a total of 3 offers, and went with the one that was the best culture and skill match.

### General Takeaways
1. __Yeah, this is a numbers game, but prioritize quality over quantity__. Most of the Indeed/Monster/big job aggregate postings I applied to never even received a response, which is both rude and disheartening. They are not a good ROI for your time, try to talk to actual people.

1. __Make connections at a steady rate__, even if you are getting interviews. There is definitely an ebb and flow with job searching, so it helps to put good solid effort into 1-2 connections every day rather than getting sloppy while applying to 7 jobs at once.

1. __Check your calendar every morning before 9:00.__ You'll probably have lots of calls, interviews, and meetings and will need to keep them all straight. Don't make my mistake; I was late to a remote pairing for a job I really liked, and you basically can't recover from that. And if you make a big mistake, it's ok, it happens. You'll still get a job.

1. __"Could you describe the lifecycle of your code?"__ This was my favorite question to ask in interviews. It was a great way to find out how code is implemented and the kinds of tools you might be using on the job. Plus, the developers I asked were generally excited to share that kind of detail, and it often led to other questions, and the tools they mentioned were very often ones I'd encountered at Turing.

1. __Exercise/have hobbies/socialize.__ This is certainly a 'do as I say, not as I do' situation. Don't forget about all of your other basic needs, and don't neglect self-care. It will make the whole process much easier, and your loved ones will thank you.

### Thank you
This would not have been possible without the staff and students at the [Turing School](), as well as my wonderful, supportive, and very patient family. I would like to specifically thank Meg Stewart at Turing for some much appreciated and timely advice, [Ian Douglas](https://iandouglas.com/) for his incredibly helpful coaching, resume review, and tech interview tips, and my rejection buddy Jesse for keeping me accountable.

### * About Those Rejections
I came across a concept a few years ago that was instrumental in helping me reframe how I think about failure. It was based on [this post about 100 rejections](http://lithub.com/why-you-should-aim-for-100-rejections-a-year/). Basically, the writer asked his friend how she was able to get all of these prestigious awards/honors/residencies and she told him about her yearly goal of getting rejected 100 times. Although I fell far short of 100 rejections, having a rejection quota really took the sting out of every single one of those rejection emails.
